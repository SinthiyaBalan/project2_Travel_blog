                <h3>CAMBODIA TRAVEL GUIDE</h3>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">Cambodia is a country with bright smiles and a dark past. It’s hard to forget the Communist genocide that happened here in the 1970s, but Cambodia is still a fascinating place to visit and the people are very friendly to outsiders.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="tour-desc">The Siem Reap area of Cambodia is home to the world famous Angkor Wat ruins, which bring in millions of tourists every year. Exploring the Angkor Wat feels a bit like stepping into The Jungle Book. These are massive Hindu temple ruins from the 12th century that cover hundreds of acres of land.</p>

                <h2><strong> Ta Prohm Temple Ruins: Famous Angkor Wat Tree In Cambodia</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">The Ta Prohm Temple (and its famous Angkor Wat tree) is one of the most photogenic temples in Cambodia.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">It’s known as the “Tomb Raider temple” for being featured in the 2001 Angelina Jolie movie, and if you’re into travel (or history), then chances are you’ve seen pictures of this place before.</p>

                <h2><strong> Angkor Wat Temple</strong></h2>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">As a gateway to the famous Angkor Wat temples, Siem Reap is the cornerstone of Cambodia’s tourism and it’s definitely one of the best travel destinations to put on your Cambodia itinerary.</p>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">You could easily spend a week or two exploring everything in the Siem Reap area, but the top highlights can be seen with 3 or 4 days in Cambodia if you’re limited on time.</p>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">Angkor Wat temple is one of the highlights of a trip to Cambodia, and it draws millions of international tourists every year.</p>

                <h2><strong> Best Time To Visit Cambodia & Angkor Wat</strong></h2>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">The climate of Cambodia is tropical, so the weather is hot and humid year round.</p>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">The rainy season runs from May to November (but especially the months of September and October), and the sunny season runs from December to April.</p>
                <br><p class="tour-desc">Try to get an early start in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds.</p>
