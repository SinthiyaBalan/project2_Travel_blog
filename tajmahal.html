                <h2><strong> What is The Taj Mahal? Who Built It?</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">The Taj Mahal is a huge monument, palace, and tomb built in 1632 by emperor Shah Jahan for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The couple is buried together inside the Taj Mahal.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">The white marble dome was built by 20,000 artisans and the project took decades to finish. It’s surrounded by a 40 acre garden with pools, fountains, and decorative walls.</p>

                <h2><strong> Where Is The Taj Mahal Located?</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">First things first — where is the Taj Mahal? The Taj Mahal is located in the city of Agra, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">Agra does not have its own international airport. That means the closest international airport to fly into is Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) in New Delhi, which is 140 miles (230 km) from Agra.</p>

                <h2><strong> Going Inside The Taj Mahal</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">You can go inside the Taj, but you will be required to remove your shoes/sandals and go barefoot, or wear shoe covers.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">This is to protect the marble flooring since there are millions of people walking through here every year.</p>
                <h2><strong> When To Visit</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">Any month is OK for visiting the Taj Mahal, but the summer months (especially April-July) are not ideal because Agra can get <strong>very</strong> hot around that time.</p>
