                <p class="tour-desc">Thailand’s Phang Nga Bay is loaded with exotic island scenery, and one of the best things to see in the bay would have to be the famous James Bond Island, with its unusual balanced rock.</p>
               
                <p class="tour-desc">This travel guide will explain how to get to the Phuket and what to expect, including the current entrance fees, where to stay, and everything else you need to know before you go!</p>

                <h2><strong> Best Phang Nga Bay Tour Packages</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">The only way to visit James Bond Island is with a tour, and GetYourGuide has prearranged day tours from Phuket or similar day trips from Khao Lak or Krabi, complete with hotel transfers, boat ride, lunch, shared tour of the islands, and same day return.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">These day tours visit all of the top sights in Phang Nga Bay, including James Bond Island, Hong island, and the Koh Panyee floating village, and you can also use a canoe or kayak to explore some of the limestone caves up close.</p>

                <h2><strong> Where Is James Bond Island?</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">James Bond Island is located in Phang Nga Bay, in southern Thailand.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">There’s no airport, hotels, or accommodation in the bay since it’s a national park, but you can easily visit from other places in Thailand.</p>

                <h2><strong> Visiting James Bond Island: What To Expect</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">It’s a very unusual island covered with limestone hills, and the main attraction is the pointy balanced rock, which seems to float on the sea. Unlike other places in Thailand, the snorkeling isn’t any good at Phang Nga Bay because the water is murky and there’s no coral.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">However, if you’re lucky, you still might see some wildlife here. We saw a hawk flying around, and later on we spotted a baby monitor lizard near the beach. We took a few pictures of him before he climbed a tree and disappeared.</p>

                <h2><strong> Best Time To Visit James Bond Island Thailand</strong></h2>
                <p class="tour-desc">The weather in the Andaman Sea area of Thailand (including Phang Nga Bay) is best from November to April, when it’s more dry and sunny. However, this is also the peak tourist season, so it’s a bit more crowded with day tours.</p>
                <p class="tour-desc">The weather is not as good from May to October. There are more rainy days, and there are frequent storms in the evenings. However, there are less tourists in these months and it’s still possible to have a great trip.</p>
